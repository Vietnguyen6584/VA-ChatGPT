[{"sender": "va", "text": ", it\u2019s the weekend, and that means it\u2019s time for some good old-fashioned time-wasting.\n\nI\u2019ve been playing a lot of the new Call of Duty: Ghosts lately, and I\u2019ve noticed a few things that are a little strange.\n\nFirst of all, the game seems to be a lot more forgiving than previous Call of Duty games. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve played the game more or because the game is actually easier, but I feel like I\u2019m able to get away with a lot more mistakes than I used to.\n\nSecondly, I feel like the game is a lot more linear than it used to be. There are still a few open areas, but for the most part, the game seems to funnel you down a specific path.\n\nLastly, I feel like the game is a lot more focused on killstreaks than it used to be. In the past, killstreaks were a nice bonus, but they weren\u2019t necessarily the focus of the game. In Ghosts, however, it seems like killstreaks are the be-all, end-all.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m still enjoying the game. But it\u2019s definitely different than what I\u2019m used to.", "timestamp": 1683983408.2163546}]
